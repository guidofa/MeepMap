# MeepMap

MeepMap is a mapping application that allows users to view markers on a map. The app is built using Clean Architecture principles to ensure maintainable and scalable code.

# Architecture
MeepMap uses Clean Architecture, which is a set of principles that separate the code into three layers:

* Presentation: responsible for UI and user interactions
* Domain: contains the business logic
* Data: responsible for data access and persistence

This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.
